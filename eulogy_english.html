        <p id="message">Wow, just wow. My heart is overflowing seeing the immense turnout to celebrate Eugene's life and support of our family. Thank you. It speaks volumes about how remarkable of a person he was.
            Eugene was born and raised in Tacoma and lived here all his life. He was raised alongside his four brothers—Roland, Alan, Jerry, and Steve. Growing up with four brothers surely made for lively days in their household. Can you imagine the chaos of five boys under one roof? His poor mother. Even the neighbors had their hands full with five rowdy boys close in age, so there was always someone getting into trouble or causing mischief. The only girls around were when his cousins Cindy and Debbie came to visit. He was especially close to Cindy and often talked about his childhood days with her.
            Eugene was a chubby kid in the early days; his older brother would tease him and call him Pugsley (Pugsley was a chubby boy from the Addams Family TV show). When his brother Steve tried calling him Pugsley, Eugene chased him down and beat him up. His elementary school years were marked by the formation of lifelong friendships, notably with Dave Carroll, with whom he shared countless adventures with and cherished many memories.
            Education didn't quite capture Eugene's interest, leading him to drop out at 17. However, he later pursued welding at Trade School, a decision that would shape his career. After completion, he tried to get a job, but no one would hire him without a high school diploma, so he ended up going back to high school and graduated at 20. During these years, Eugene would often party with his brothers, as they were old enough to buy alcohol and weed. He loved to have a good time. Eugene was a welder at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyards where he had a medical retirement after 26 years. He tried to spend as much time as possible hiding in the bathrooms and reading the newspapers to avoid work.
            We met at 16 and fell in love, but the time wasn't right for us, so we parted for 6 years. Then one day, I went shopping at Safeway with my friend Tammy. Eugene was there and tried to get my attention, but I tried to ignore him. Tammy on the other hand got his information and proceeded to make a plan to get us back together (she knew I still loved him). Well, it worked. We got back together and got married on March 25, 1985. Our love lasted 45 years including our high school days.
            He enjoyed his young years drinking and smoking weed so much that he ended up having liver failure and almost died. On May 25th, 2011, Eugene received a new liver which gave us twelve and a half extra years together; we are forever grateful for the donor and doctors who saved his life. He always thought that his donor was a female because he would easily get emotional after he received his new liver.
            At home, he enjoyed watching TV—stupid, silly shows like South Park, Beavis and Butt-head, Rick and Morty, The Simpsons and more. I would get so mad when he watched South Park with the kids. He also liked playing cards and board games such as Pinochle, Dominos and Cribbage with family and friends, teaching the kids to play at a young age.
            Eugene loved kids and was a fun-loving Uncle and good father to his daughters: Danyel, Brandy, & Erin. Even though we didn’t have a lot of money together we found ways to take our kids places and spend time with them. He was always so very proud of all of their accomplishments. He also had a son James that he didn't meet until James was 18. I'll never forget how nervous and excited he was to meet James. He didn't really say it much but he always told me that he loved all of his kids very much.
            He was fortunate to have exceptional sons-in-laws whom he imparted wisdom to and who reciprocated with their support. He held deep affection for each and every one of them. He found immense joy in knowing his daughters would be well looked after and happy in their life. He was also fond of his daughter-in-law, cherishing her as another beloved member of his family, and took great comfort in seeing her embraced within the fold of his family.
            When the grandkids came along, he was thrilled. As they grew, he loved to play with them and teach them things. In his eyes, they could do no wrong even when Emili drew on his TV and the underside of the coffee table with a marker. He truly loved spending time with them. He also had a great grandchild.
            Family and friend time was his favorite, whether it be camping, a road trip, playing games, or going on vacation—he said the best times were with me, his kids, grandkids, friends and exchange students. He loved hosting international students. We started in 1989 and never stopped. He grew to love so many of the kids from all over the world and was always trying to make them feel comfortable and at home. His exchange students became like family, two even marrying his daughters. To many of them, he was more than just a host - he was their American father. He cared for them as if they were his own, showing them warmth and support throughout their time together. He also cherished his American friends dearly, although he didn’t have many, the ones he did have were special.
            His passion for travel took him far and wide, with each journey leaving indelible memories. He visited Japan many times, Hong Kong, Thailand, London twice, and his final trip abroad, France (his dream came true, to see the Eiffel Tower). He visited several states, with Hawaii being one of his favorites. Yet, amidst his adventures, Eugene's heart always longed for home, where his beloved dogs awaited his return.
            Speaking of which, his adoration for dogs knew no bounds; he adored them and pampered them endlessly. Not limited to dogs, his love extended to all animals. 
            In addition, he found great happiness in raising his cherished dogs, delighting in the playful behavior of the puppies. It brought him comfort to know that his puppies found loving homes, although he admitted he would have kept them all if he could have.
            During his final days, he amazed me. I did not really know how strong he was until we knew he was dying. We cried together, but only for a very short time; after that, he said no more crying. He wanted to see everyone possible, call people to say goodbye, share stories with visitors. He wanted family and friends by his side. He wanted to eat Marion Berry Pie with French vanilla ice cream, put up the Christmas tree, and smoke weed one last time. (He hadn't smoked for at least 15 years). He wanted to go out on his own terms at home and surrounded by his family. He promised me that he would be a good spirit in our home. He lived life to the fullest; his biggest regret was not taking better care of his body when he was younger. While he may no longer be with us physically, his spirit will forever reside in our hearts, guiding us with his warmth and wisdom. May we remember him with smiles, just as he wished.
